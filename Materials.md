#  Materials List — Cloud Chamber Project

This file lists the materials and tools required to build my DIY cloud chamber to detect cosmic ray muons and other charged particles.  
The setup is designed to create a **supersaturated alcohol vapor layer** where particles leave visible trails.

---

##  Core Materials
-  **Fish tank** — used as the main chamber enclosure.  
-  **Isopropyl alcohol (≥ 90%)** — creates the vapor layer.  
-  **Black felt** — holds the alcohol and lines the top surface to increase evaporation.  
-  **Dry ice** — cools the base of the chamber to produce supersaturation.  
-  **Flashlight** — provides side lighting to make particle trails visible.  
-  **Camera** — used to record particle tracks for analysis.

##  Planned Additions
(More components will be added as the project evolves.)
-  **Python detection script** — will analyze recorded footage to detect and highlight particle tracks.  
-  **Optional sensors or counters** — for enhanced detection and data collection.

---

##  Safety Notes
- Handle **isopropyl alcohol** carefully — it is flammable.  
- Use **dry ice** with gloves or tongs to avoid frostbite.  
- Work in a **well-ventilated area**.  
- Avoid any open flames near the setup.

 *This list will be updated as the experiment develops and additional electronics or software tools are integrated.*
