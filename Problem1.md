## Challenge 1: Maintaining a Seal Without Damaging the Chamber

**Goal**  
I was building a homemade cloud chamber to observe muons. For the chamber to work, the transparent container needed to remain sealed against the dry ice tray so gas would not escape.

**What went wrong**  
At first, the container did not have enough weight to maintain a tight seal, which allowed gas to escape and made particle tracks unreliable.

**Initial attempt (and why it failed)**  
My first idea was to place weight directly on the center of the container to increase downward force. In the video, this can be seen when I placed a bottle of isopropyl alcohol on top of the chamber. While this improved the seal, it put too much strain on the container and risked cracking it.

**Why I changed my approach**  
This made me realize that the issue wasn’t how much weight I added, but *where* the weight was applied. Concentrating force at the center increased stress without solving the problem safely.

**What I changed**  
I pivoted to placing smaller amounts of weight around the container in a controlled pattern. This increased pressure at the edges where the seal mattered most, while reducing stress on the center of the container.

**Result**  
After changing the weight distribution, gas leakage was reduced and the cloud chamber became stable enough to consistently observe particle tracks without damaging the container.

**What I learned**  
This problem taught me that engineering solutions often involve tradeoffs. Increasing force is not always the answer — distributing it intelligently can be more effective.

- No added weight (gas leakage visible): 0:40  
- Weight placed at center causing strain: 0:43
