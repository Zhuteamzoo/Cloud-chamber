## Challenge 1: Maintaining a Seal Without Damaging the Chamber

**Goal**  
I was building a homemade cloud chamber to observe muons. For the chamber to work, the transparent container needed to remain sealed against the dry ice tray so gas would not escape.

**What went wrong**  
When I placed the container on the tray, it did not have enough weight to create a tight seal. Gas escaped from the bottom, which made the particle tracks inconsistent and difficult to observe.

**Why this happened**  
At first, I assumed the container’s own weight would be sufficient. After testing multiple times, I realized the issue was not the seal material but the lack of downward force. Adding too much weight, however, risked cracking or crushing the container.

**What I changed**  
Instead of adding weight evenly, I placed small weights in a specific pattern around the container. This increased pressure where the seal mattered most while avoiding excessive stress on the center of the container.

**Result**  
Gas leakage was significantly reduced, and the cloud chamber became stable enough to consistently observe particle tracks without damaging the container.

**What I learned**  
This problem taught me that engineering solutions often involve balancing competing constraints. Where force is applied can matter more than how much force is applied.
