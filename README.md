#  DIY Cloud Chamber — Detecting Cosmic Rays

This project documents my attempt to **build a cloud chamber** in my basement to **detect cosmic rays**.  
A cloud chamber allows us to make **invisible subatomic particles** visible by leaving trails in a **supersaturated alcohol vapor**.

##  Project Goal
The main goal of this experiment is to **observe muons** produced high in the atmosphere and **detect their tracks** at ground level.  
These muons should not reach Earth’s surface according to classical physics — but they **do**, thanks to **time dilation** predicted by special relativity.  
By observing these tracks, I aim to demonstrate **real-world evidence of special relativity**.

##  How a Cloud Chamber Works
A cloud chamber is a sealed container filled with alcohol vapor.  
- The bottom of the chamber is cooled, creating a **supersaturated layer** of alcohol vapor.  
- When a charged particle (like a muon) passes through, it **ionizes the vapor**.  
- The vapor condenses along the ionization trail, forming a **visible streak** that reveals the particle’s path.

##  Materials Used
- Isopropyl alcohol (high concentration)  
- Insulated container (for the chamber)  
- Dry ice (to cool the base)  
- Black felt (to hold alcohol)  
- Flashlight (for illumination)  

##  Why Muons Matter
Muons are created when cosmic rays collide with particles in the upper atmosphere.  
They travel close to the **speed of light**, and their **lifetime is extended** due to **time dilation**.  
This allows them to survive long enough to be detected at the surface.

##  What I Hope to Observe
- **Straight thin tracks** → fast muons or other charged particles  
- **Short, thick tracks** → slower, more heavily ionizing particles  
- Possibly **delta rays** (secondary electrons) from muon interactions

##  Future Improvements
- Better temperature control at the base for longer viewing time  
- Using a camera to record tracks for analysis
