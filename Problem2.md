## Challenge 2: Lighting the Chamber

**Goal**  
To clearly observe particle tracks in the cloud chamber, I needed a strong, even light source that could illuminate the interior of the chamber.

**What went wrong**  
The flashlight I initially used was too weak and unstable, making it difficult to see particle tracks clearly.

**Initial attempt (and its limitation)**  
I decided to use my dad’s iPhone as a light source by placing it horizontally on the tray to shine light across the chamber. This significantly improved visibility, but the tray was extremely cold, which caused the phone’s battery to drain very quickly.

**Why this happened**  
I realized that the low temperature of the tray was affecting the phone’s battery performance. While the lighting problem was solved, it introduced a new issue related to heat transfer.

**What I changed**  
To reduce direct contact with the cold surface, I placed a cloth between the phone and the tray. This helped insulate the phone while still allowing it to provide consistent lighting.

**Result**  
With the cloth acting as insulation, the phone battery drained much more slowly, and I was able to observe particle tracks clearly for longer periods of time.

**What I learned**  
This problem taught me that solving one issue can create another. I learned to think about secondary effects, such as temperature and energy loss, when choosing materials and setups.
